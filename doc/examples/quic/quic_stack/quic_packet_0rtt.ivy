# The packet protocol
#
# The packet protocol has several funcitons including establishing
# connections and loss detection. Packets carry frames whihc implement
# many other funcition of QUIC.
#
# QUIC Packets
# ------------

# This section defines the QUIC packet datatype. Packets are the basic
# unit of communication between endpoints. A packet may be encoded in
# either the long or the short format. There are packet types:
# `initial`, `handshake`, `zero_rtt` and `one_rtt`. The `zero_rtt`
# type is encoded in the short format, while others are encoded in the
# long format.  Packets have associated source cid (long format only)
# and destination cid, protocol version (long format only), and a
# packet sequence number. An initial packet also has a *retry token*, which
# is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes.  The *payload* of the
# packet consists of a sequence of *frames* (see frame.ivy).

# TODO: retry and one_rtt packet types

# ### Packet

# The type `quic_packet` represents packet. 

# The fields are:
#
# - *ptype*: the packet type [2]
# - *pversion*: the protocol version, if long format, else 0 [3]
# - *dst_cid*: the destination cid [4]
# - *src_cid*: the source cid, if long format, else 0  [5]
# - *token*: the retry token (see section 4.4.1)  [6]
# - *seq_num*: the packet sequence number  [7]
# - *payload*: the payload, a sequence of frames  [8]

    type this = struct {

# Packet protocol events
# -----------------------

# The packet event
# ================
#
# This event corresponds to transmission of a QUIC packet.
#
# Parameters
# ----------
#
# - `src`: the source endpoint
# - `dst`: the destination endpoint
# - `pkt` : the packet contents

action packet_event_0rtt(src:ip.endpoint,dst:ip.endpoint,pkt:quic_packet_0rtt) = {}

# Packet protocol state
# ---------------------

# This section defines the history variables that track the state of
# the packet protocol. Some of these variables are shared between
# protocol layers, so that the allowed interleavings of events at
# different layers can be specified.
#

# Packet protocol state
# ---------------------

# Packet event specification
# --------------------------

# A packet event represents the transmision of a QUIC packet `pkt`
# from source endpoint `src` to a QUIC destination endpoint `dst`
# containing a sequence of queued frames.
#
# ### Requirements
#
# - The packet payload may not be empty [7].
#
# - A sender may not re-use a packet number on a given connection [4].
#
# - A packet containing only ack frames and padding is *ack-only*.
#   For a given cid, the number of ack-only packets sent from src to dst
#   must not be greater than the number of non-ack-only packets sent
#   from dst to src [5].
#
# - For a given connection, a server must only send packets to an
#   address that at one time in the past sent the as packet with
#   the highest packet numer thus far received. See notes below on
#   migration and path challenge. [10]

#   - Token Length:  A variable-length integer specifying the length of the
#      Token field, in bytes.  This value is zero if no token is present.
#      Initial packets sent by the server MUST set the Token Length field
#      to zero; clients that receive an Initial packet with a non-zero
#      Token Length field MUST either discard the packet or generate a
#      connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION. [11]

# Upon receiving the client's Initial packet, the server can request address validation 
# by sending a Retry packet (Section 17.2.5) containing a token. This token MUST be 
# repeated by the client in all Initial packets it sends for that connection after it 
# receives the Retry packet.

# ### Effects
#
# - The `conn_seen` and `sent_pkt` relations are updated to reflect
#   the observed packet [1].
# - The `last_pkt_num` function is updated to indicate the observed
#   packets as most recent for the packet's source and cid.
#   
#
# ### Notes
#
# - In the low-level packet encoding, the packet number may be encoded using
#   a small number of bytes, in a way that loses information.
#   At this layer of the protocol, however, the packets contain the original full
#   packet number.
#
# - On seeing a packet form a new address with the highest packect
#   number see thus far, the server detects migration of the
#   client. It begins sending packets to this address and initiates
#   path validation for this address. Until path validation succeeds,
#   the server limits data sent to the new address. Currently we
#   cannot specify this limit because we don't know the byte size of
#   packets or the timings of packets. 

#   An endpoint MUST treat the following as a connection error of type
#   TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR or PROTOCOL_VIOLATION:
#   *  absence of the retry_source_connection_id transport parameter from
#      the server after receiving a Retry packet, [1]
#   *  presence of the retry_source_connection_id transport parameter
#      when no Retry packet was received, or [3]
#   *  a mismatch between values received from a peer in these transport
#      parameters and the value sent in the corresponding Destination or
#      Source Connection ID fields of Initial packets. [2]
#   If a zero-length connection ID is selected, the corresponding
#   transport parameter is included with a zero-length value.

    # QUESTION: THis sentence is from draft-18 section 13.1: "An
    #   endpoint MUST NOT send a packet containing only an ACK frame
    #   in response to a packet containing only ACK or PADDING frames,
    #   even if there are packet gaps which precede the received
    #   packet." Do we interpret this to mean that an ack-only packet
    #   cannot ack *only* ack-only packets?  Or that an ack-only
    #   packet cannot ack *any* ack-only packets?
